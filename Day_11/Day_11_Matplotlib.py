Histogram - Bar Graph of Frequency 

A histogram is used to summarize discrete or continuous data. 
In other words, it provides a visual interpretation of numerical data by 
showing the number of data points that fall within a specified range of 
values (called "bins").
However, a histogram, unlike a vertical bar graph, shows no gaps between the bars.


X Axis = width = Class Interval
Y Axis = height = Frequency

Creating a histogram provides a visual representation of data distribution.
The median and distribution of the data can be determined by a histogram.
It can show any outliers or gaps in the data.

Types of Distribution
1. Normal distribution
    Points on one side of the average are as likely to occur as on the other 
    side of the average

2. Bimodal distribution
    There are two peaks
    The data should be separated and analyzed as separate normal distributions
    
3. Right-skewed distribution
    A large number of the data values occur on the left side 

4. Left-skewed distribution
    A large number of the data values occur on the right side

5. Random distribution
    Has several peaks
