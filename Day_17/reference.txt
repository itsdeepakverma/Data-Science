South Africa Heart Disease Dataset
* Description
A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two controls per case of CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have undergone blood pressure reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk factors after their CHD event. In some cases the measurements were made after these treatments. These data are taken from a larger dataset, described in Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African Medical Journal.
