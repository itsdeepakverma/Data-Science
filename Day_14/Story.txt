Key Machine Learning Terminology

Descriptive - What Happened
Predictive - What will happen
Prescriptive - What to do 


Gang of Four (Yann Lecun, Geoffrey Hilton, Yoshua Bengio, Andrew Ng )
    CoFounder of Coursera and Baidu (Andrew Ng )
    How to boost GDP of India with Prime minister  ?
    Father of Machine Learning ( Geoffrey Hilton )
    Head of Google AI team since 2001
    Research Student of Hilton (Yann Lecun )
    Heading Facebook AI Team ( Yann Lecun )
    Father of Deep Learning
    Yoshua Bengio is purely Academician, writes Books and Papers
    

Define Artificial Intellegence ( AI )
    Any machine which can behave like humans for a specific task
    Narrow AI
    Generalized AI
    There are two ways to achieve it ( Machine Learning and Deep Learning )
    Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning using Neueral Networks


Define Data Analytics
    Inference from past Data

Define Machine Learning
    Based on past data if we can predict
    
    
Define BigData
    If the dataset is big, which cannot be processed on your local system
    Distributed computation or Parallel Computing on a cluster is the solution 
    to solve the Big Data Problem
    Map and Reduce is the base concept developed by an India in Google
    Frameworks - Apache Hadoop and Spark and now Datbricks


Define Streaming Analytics
    When the data is changing at runtime, like Facebbok Like and Comments
    Kafka, Solr and Lucene 


Define Data Science 
    Anything around data is known as data science
    Dr. D G Patil, First Data Scientist in Obama Administration.
    He coined the word Data Scientist 
    Sexiest Job in the world is of a Data Scientist 
    

Define Machine Learning
    y = f(x) 
    y is output variable / dependent variable / labels 
    x is input variable / independent variable / features describing the data
    f is known as a mapping function / Model 
    ML = Process of training the Model for prediction on never-before-seen dataset
    

    In a traditional system you have x and the mapping function f()
    and you generate the values of y

    In a ML system, you have x and y and based on that we find the mapping function f()
    Once you know the mapping function, we can then give new x values which will predict y
    
    
    In Machine Learning 
        x = Feature
        y = Label / Response / Target
        
    f(newx) ==> y - prediction
    x = [1,2,3,4,5] {6}
    y = [1,2,3,4,5] ??

    Prediction can be of two types 
    1. Continuous values ( Regression Model )
    2. Discrete Values   ( Classification Model )



Define Dataset
    If both feature(x) and label(y) is present in the data, it is known as Labelled Dataset
    student_scores.csv
    Supervised ML works on Labelled dataset for predictions
    
    If only feature (x) is present and label (y) is missing in a data, its a non labelled dataset
    Unsupervised ML works on unlabelled data.
    Predictions are not possible, only groups can be created ( clustering )
    

    Supervised ML ( Predictions ) has two branches Regression and Classification 
    Regression- 
    Classification kNN, 
    
    Unsupervised ML ( Clustering ) has two branches Clustering and Association 
    Clustering - kmeans
    Association - Apriori
    
    Will netaji WIN or LOOSE in the election is an example of Classification 
    With how many votes is an example of Regression 
    
    
    
    Give ( Classification )Example of Spam Detection of Email to explain the below concept
    In the spam detector example, the features could include the following:
    (feature)          words in the email text
    (feature)          sender's address
    (feature)          time of day the email was sent
    (feature)          email contains the phrase "one weird trick."
    (label )           Whether the email is SPAM or HAM

    Another ( Regression )Example is the Housing Prices in Jaipur
    housingMedianAge            (feature)
    totalRooms                  (feature)
    totalBedrooms               (feature)
    medianHouseValue            (label)



    Scikitlearn (sklearn) is the library for ML Algorithms
    
    Keras based on Tensorflie is the library for DL Algorithms
    Another library is PyTorch from Facebook/Uber
    
    

Define Deep Learning
    When the dataset is big we would the neural networks to solve it
    Supervised Deep Leaarning ( ANN, RNN, CNN )
    UnSupervised Deep Leaarning ( SOM, AutoEncoders ) Self Organising Maps 
    SOM is used for Clustering, AutoEncoders is used for developing Recommendation Systems


Define Reinforcement Learning
    In Reinforcement Learning ( RL )
    In RL you don't collect examples with labels.
    Imagine you want to teach a machine to play a very basic video game and never lose. 
    You set up the model (often called an agent in RL) with the game, and you tell 
    the model not to get a "game over" screen. 
    During training, the agent receives a reward when it performs this task, 
    which is called a reward function. With reinforcement learning, 
    the agent can learn very quickly how to outperform humans. 

    However, designing a good reward function is difficult, and RL models are less stable 
    and predictable than supervised approaches.
