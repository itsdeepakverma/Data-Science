//Advanced code challenges (Need to perform later):

This is the Prostate Cancer dataset.You can read the info file for more
information about the dataset. We have split the data into a train and test split. You should
use the test split to evaluate the model. (When training, select the ”Supplied Test set” and
select the test dataset.


Tasks
(a) Train a unregularized model - Disable the attribute selection, regularisation, and co-linear
attribute elimination and run the linear regressor. Note down the mean squared error.
(b) Ridge Regression - We have seen unregularized models till now. Weka implements ridge
regression model for linear regression which we will try. We have to choose the best
parameter lambda for ridge regression. In practice, we do this by searching over a range
of values and see which gives the least cross-validation error. Weka has functions to this
search too. We use CVParameterSearch in the meta functions, and use it to iterate over
the ridge parameter(R) of the Linear Regression model. Iterate over 0 - 50 in steps of
1, use a 5 fold cross-validation. Note down the best value of lambda and corresponding
error.



Code Challenge:
Ridge Regression Assignment 2:
In this assignment, we will run ridge regression 
multiple times with different L2 penalties to see 
which one produces the best fit. 

In particular, we will: 
• Use Linear Regression and see the results
• Use Lasso (L1) and see the resuls
• Use Ridge and see the score
• Choose best L2 penalty using cross-validation
• Assess the final fit using test data. 

We will continue to use the House data from previous assignments.
